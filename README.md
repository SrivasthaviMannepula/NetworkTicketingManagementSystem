## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the software requirements for the "Network Ticketing for Customer Inventory Data" project. It provides a detailed description of the project's objectives and functional requirements.

## 2. Project Description
The project aims to create a system that allows customers to log incidents against network elements stored in a database and resolve them efficiently.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Network Inventory Relationship
- The system must establish relationships between different network elements stored in the database.

### 3.2. User Authentication
- Customers must be able to log in with roles that provide them the option to log an incident.

### 3.3. Network Element Selection
- Customers should be able to search and select a network element (e.g., router, OLT, ONT) for reporting incidents.

### 3.4. View Related Components
- Users must be able to view the components deployed with the selected network element.

### 3.5. Incident Reporting
- Customers should be able to report various types of issues (e.g., power problems, not reachable, port not working) and create incident tickets.

### 3.6. Assignment Group
- Based on the type of issue reported, the system should automatically assign the incident to the appropriate group.

### 3.7. Incident Creation
- The system should allow the creation of incident tickets with severity and priority.

### 3.8. Resolution Comments
- Customers should have the ability to add comments for incident resolution.

## 4. Use Cases
Here are some key use cases for the "Network Ticketing for Customer Inventory Data" system:
- User logs in and selects a network element to report an incident.
- User reports an issue and creates an incident ticket.
- The system assigns the incident to the appropriate group.
- User adds resolution comments to close the incident.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** The system must ensure user data and incident information security.
- **Performance:** The system should respond promptly to user interactions.
- **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
